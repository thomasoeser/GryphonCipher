Gryphon Cipher Algorithm
The Gryphon Cipher Algorithm is a bit shifting algorithm that shifts each alphanumeric character up or down based on an extrapolated, non repeating, bit value of a given password. 

It is intended to be used as a secondary encryption method where the original encryption outputs a long alphanumeric string. The idea is to strengthen any encryption algorithm that may have attack vectors, known or unknown.
